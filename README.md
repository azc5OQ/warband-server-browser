a tool to ask warband servers for info
this tool emulates behaviour of in game client and asks for server details using UDP, not TCP like mbcentral is doing
this way information of all servers can be retrieved




btw in bannerlord this is not possible to do, client does not ask individual servers for information, server information is handed to client only from taleworlds main server
